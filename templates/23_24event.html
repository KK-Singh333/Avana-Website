        <h2>Cloth Donation Drive</h2>
        <p>
            We spearheaded a campus-wide clothing drive in May. This initiative aimed to collect clothing and stationary items from all corners of the campus, extending the spirit of generosity to the broader community. Volunteers traversed the campus, engaging with hostel residents to solicit their support for the noble cause. In each hostel, designated collection boxes were stationed, serving as beacons of hope for those in need.

        <h2>Village Visit</h2>
        <p>
            In Baalda gaon, we met 3-4 farmers and one poultry farm owner. The farmers mostly grow potato, wheat, chana, tomato, and chilly according to the season. They used tractors in their fields for plowing and sowing. Water requirements are met by the automatic pump system connected to the wells.

        <h2>Old Age Home Visit</h2>
        <p>
            On 27 Jan 2024, we visited Jagganath Narayan Vridhashram, a residential facility for elderly individuals. The purpose of the visit was to engage with the residents through various activities aimed at bringing joy, companionship, and support to the elderly members of our community. Through engaging activities such as an antakshari competition, Chopai recitation, grocery distribution, and dance, we were able to brighten the lives of the elderly residents and create lasting bonds within the community.

        <h2>Blood Donation Camp</h2>
        <p>
            IIT Indore celebrated its 15th anniversary of establishment through an act of selfless benevolence - a Blood Donation Drive hosted by the Avana club on 7 February 2024. Inaugurated by our honorable Director, Dr. Suhas Joshi himself, the drive was graced by the presence of distinguished guests and was a collaborative effort between IITI's Health Centre and a local medical college. An unusual choice of location for such an event, the passage leading up to the Nalanda auditorium, was decked in striking posters depicting the importance of and care to be taken before and after blood donation.
