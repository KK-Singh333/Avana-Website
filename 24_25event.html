        <h2>Cloth Donation Drive</h2>
        <p>
            We spearheaded a campus-wide clothing drive in May. This initiative aimed to collect clothing and stationary items from all corners of the campus, extending the spirit of generosity to the broader community. Volunteers traversed the campus, engaging with hostel residents to solicit their support for the noble cause. In each hostel, designated collection boxes were stationed, serving as beacons of hope for those in need.

        <h2>Margdarshan</h2>
        <p>
            Margdarshan is Avana's initiative to support underprivileged students from government schools through weekend tutoring sessions. It aims to bridge educational gaps by providing academic support to empower students academically. Every weekend, members and volunteers from Avana gather to lend a helping hand to students from government schools, offering academic support across various subjects, including mathematics, science, language arts, and more. Through dedicated mentorship, we strive to instill a love for learning, cultivate critical thinking skills, and unlock doors of opportunity that may have otherwise remained closed.
